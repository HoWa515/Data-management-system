# Data-management-system
This is a mini data management system ：
Use data_info.txt to simulate a database that contains business cards;
Run "main.py", follow instructions step by step to perform “CRUD” operations on this database;
"tools.py" is written to pack all the corresponding functions;
When press '0' and exit the system,  the modified data will be automatically saved in Json onto local file 'data_info.txt';
